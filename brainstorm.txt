First of all, please for the love of god do not write your own drivers.
I mean, I guess you can really. Writing drivers is probably not that bad of an idea
Especially if they aren't hard to write.
However, don't restrict yourself. There are universal driver standards you could implement
That would allow you to add a bunch of other people's drivers yourself.
